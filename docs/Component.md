# Component

Components are the datatypes we use in ECS.
In **Ape ECS** Components are single shallow Objects with predefined properties.
Those properties can reference JavaScript types and special Entity Reference values.

üëÄ See the [Entity Ref Docs](./Refs.md) for more on Entity Reference properties.

üëÄ See the [World registerComponent documentation](./World.md#registercomponent) for information on how to define a new Component type.

Components can only exist when they're part of an Entity.
You can have any number of the same Component type within an Entity.
You create instances of a Component either by defining them within [world.createEnitity](./World.md#createentity), [world.createEntities](./World.md#createentities), or [entity.addComponent](./Entity.md#addcomponent).
Component instances are destroyed through [component.destroy](#destroy) or [entity.removeComponent](./Entity.md#removecomponent).

Component property values can be accessed and changed directly on the Component instance like any other object.

Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Due to an optimization, Component properties are not reflected through introspection, like `console.log`, but they're there if you defined them with `world.registerComponent`. Properties are actually getter/setters on the Component prototype and stored within `component._meta.values`, so you can't enumerate them or inspect them directly.

## Example

```js
world.registerComponent('Position', {
  properties: {
    x: 0,
    y: 0
  }
}, 10);

world.registerComponent('Buff', {
  properties: {
    armor: 10
  }
}, 10);

const entity = world.createEntity({
  components: [
    {
      type: 'Buff',
      armor: 10
    }
    {
      type: 'Buff',
      armor: 3
    }
  ],
  c: {
  Position: 
    x: 3,
    y: 28
  }
});

console.log(entity.Position.x, entity.Position.y); // 3  28
entity.Position.x = 13;
entity.Position.y = 4;
console.log(entity.Position.x, entity.Position.y); // 13  4
for (const buff of entity.types.Buff) {
  console.log(buff.armor);
}
// 10
// 3
console.log(entity.getObject());
/*
{
  id: 'aaabbbccc-32',
  tags: [],
  components: [
    {
      id: 'lkjasdf-2',
      type: 'Buff',
      armor: 10
    },
    {
      id: 'lkjasdf-3',
      type: 'Buff',
      armor: 3
    }
  ],
  c: {
    Position: {
      id: 'lkjasdf-4',
      type: 'Position',
      lookup: 'Position',
      x: 13,
      y: 4
    }
  }
}
*/
```

## creating

There are a few factory functions for creating Components. When you create `Entities` you can include the initial components and their values.

* [world.createEntity](./World.md#createentity)
* [world.createEntities](./World.md#createentities)

Or you can add them on to an existing `Entity`.
* [entity.addComponent](./Entity.md#addcomponent)

Regardless of the method you use to create a `Component`, the format is as follows:

```js
{
  type: 'Position', // Component Type
  id: 'hi-there', // optional, unique id, auto generated if not provided
  lookup: 'position', // optional, if set you can access the component by this value from the Entity instance
  // see below for more on lookups
  x: 34, // set the initial value of any property defined when registered
  y: 3 // another property that you previously defined
  // you don't have to assign values to all of your properties
}
```

üìë Related, you can always add `Tags`, which are similar to Components, except they're just the name/type. [entity.addTag](./Entity.md#addtag)

‚òùÔ∏è `Components` can't exist without being part of an `Entity`. A future release may add more ways to use `Components.`

üí≠ `Components` are pooled by their type. When you [world.registerComponent](./World.md#registercomponent), set a pool size close to the number of a given type you expect to exist at a time. The `Component` pools add some efficiency, and lowers the amount of CPU time the JavaScript [garbage collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) needs.

## id

The id property of a `Component` is a `String` that has generally been auto-generated.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not reassign the id of an `Entity` or `Component` after they have been created. Here there be dragons. üêâ

## properties

You can access any property directly on a `Component` instance that you have registered with the component.

See the [example](#example) at the [top of this document](#component).

‚ö†Ô∏è If you assign any new properties to a `Component` that you didn't register, they won't behave properly.

## lookup

Setting the lookup property will map the `Component` within its `Entity` by that value for convenience in addition to the set of Components of that type within the `entity.components['ComponentTypeNameHere']` `Set`.

```js
const entity = world.createEntity({
  components: [
    {
      type: 'Position',
      lookup: 'position',
      x: 3,
      y: 10
    }
  ]
});

console.log(entity.position.x); // 3

for (const position of entity.types.Position) {
  console.log(position.x, position.y);
}
// 3 10
```

You can also set the lookup in an `Entity` creation factory the `c` property.

This is equivalant to the above:
```js
const entity = world.createEntity({
  c: {
    position: {
      type: 'Position',
      x: 3,
      y: 10
    }
  }
});
```

## entity

The entity property gives you access to the parent `Entity` instance.

## getObject

Get a serializable version of the Component.

```js
const obj = component.getObject();
console.log(obj);
```
```js
{
  type: 'Point', // component type name
  id: 'aabbbcc-37', // generated or assigned component id
  entityId: 'kjasdlf-03', // generated or assigned entity id
  lookup: 'point', // assigned lookup, if set
  x: 38, // any properties that you registered
  y: 44
}
```

‚òùÔ∏è If you included any registered properties in the `{ serialize: { ignore: [] }}` during [world.registerComponent](./World#registercomponent), then those properties won't be in the resulting object.

‚òùÔ∏è You can use the results of `component.getObject` as the component in [entity.addComponent](./Entity.md#addcomponent) and as a component part in [world.createEntity](./World.md#createentity) and [world.createEntities](./World.md#createentities).

## destroy

Destroy the component.

```js
someComponent.destroy();
```

Before any other actions are taken, the `init` function you can define in [world.registerComponent](./World.md#registercomponent) is ran if specified.

üí≠ This has the same effect as [entity.removeComponent](./Entity.md#removecomponent). This clears all the data in the component and releases it back to the `Component` pool of its type.
